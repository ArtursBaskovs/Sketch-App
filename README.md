# This project is in its early stage

Planning on developing webb application where user can sketch from references in canva.
There will be different mode user will be able to choose from. For example "Fast Skethcing", where user will get a reference image and limited time to sketch it, then recieve next image. And after there will be other sketcing modes with different rules.
